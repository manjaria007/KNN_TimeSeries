# KNN_TimeSeries
# Utilized Google Trends dataset i.e. search terms "Predictive Analytics" over the past 5years
# Applied KNN regressor time series method for finding the best combination of parameters to predict the values of the series for the latest week
# Prediction value depends on the value of k. Note that as n increases, the maximum value of k might decrease because of the small size of the dataset
# Another element that affects performance is the distance function (Euclidean and Manhattan distance functions for each combination of n and k)
# Reported accuracy for each combination of n, k and distance function (16 experiments in total)
